# The influence of Twitter bots in 2019 Canadian federal elections at British Columbia.

### Summary

Social bots can affect online communication among humans. Previous research suggests that bots are present on political discussions and social movements. We are going to study the Twitter bots’ presence and its influence on the political discussions about the 2019 Canadian federal elections at British Columbia during the period of 4 months before the elections on October 21th of 2019.

###  Motivation

The popularity of Twitter, that positions it within the top 20 most popular social networks worldwide as of April 2019 with 330 million monthly active users, has attracted many automated programs which are known as “Bots”. These programs have appeared to be a double-edged sword for this social network.

Bots can autonomously carry out actions such as tweet or re-tweet, as well as follow, unfollow or directly message other Twitter accounts. Beneficial uses of bots include the transmission of useful information such as global news, the automatic generation of interesting or creative content, and the automatic response to Twitter users through direct messages. In contrast, malign bots spread spam or malicious content and distort the shared information.

As Twitter became an important tool for protests, political conversations, and people mobilizations, the damage to shared info through this social media increased significantly. On September 2017, Twitter’s executives informed the Intelligence Committee of the United States that they have found evidence that signaled Russia was behind some fake and automatized accounts that were active during the 2016 presidential election. Studies have found that about 20% of the activity on Twitter related to such elections came from bots’ suspicious accounts.

In contrast to the United States, it appears that the influence of Twitter bots on Canada is limited. A study from 2014 found that just under half of Canadians have visited a government website. Even fewer have friended or followed a political actor on Facebook (6 percent) or Twitter (4 percent). It appears that not only do Canadians avoid politicians online, they avoid politics all of sorts. Only 18 percent of Canadians have signed a petition, posted a political message on Facebook (14 percent) or retweeted political content (3 percent).

Previous qualitative research on the usage of political bots found that Twitter bots had a limited impact in the social media discourse during 2015 Canada federal election and identified four mainly kinds of bots in the Canadian political ecosystem: dampeners, amplifiers, transparency and servant bots.

### Objectives

We aim to analyze the presence of Twitter bots and the information they disseminated at British Columbia during the 43rd Canadian general election through the following goals:

- To describe the time evolution of tweets with political discourse in the months leading to the 2019 Canadian federal elections.
- To study the presence of bots, classify, and characterize them according to their account characteristics.
- To analyze the types of tweets that are issued by each type of bot according to their content, and investigate if bots can be classified under the classes: ‘Dampeners’, ‘Amplifiers’ and ‘Transparency’, which were proposed in the qualitative research of 2015 Canada federal elections.
